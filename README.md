> Because data saves lives (and our sanity)!

Hey there! Welcome to the **ER Analytics Dashboard** — your one-stop shop to track chaos and calm in the Emergency Room.  

This project slices, dices, and juliennes ER data to answer burning questions like:
- **How many patients showed up today?**
- **How long did folks wait?**
- **Were they smiling when they left?** (A.K.A. satisfaction scores)

---

## 📊 What's Inside?

This repo packs an analytics punch:

- **Daily ER Patient Volume**
  - Total unique patients per day.
- **Average Wait Time**
  - How long, on average, folks sat there practicing patience.
- **Patient Satisfaction Trends**
  - Smiles (or frowns) plotted over time.

All this data is sourced from the mighty Excel file:

The hero of this project! It includes:

| Date   | No. of Patients | Avg Wait Time (mins) | Avg Satisfaction Score |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1-May  | 34              | 33.2                 | 6.86                   |
| 2-May  | 37              | 30.1                 | 4.36                   |
